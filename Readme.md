## Deployment


### Local Server
To run in a local server use : nodemon src/app.js -e js.hbs

Or

As i have added the nodemon as dev dependency so you can simply use: npm start dev

It is becasuse previously we have nodemon as global but then we installed it as: npm i nodemon --save-dev

It means it will run only during the development enviroment.
